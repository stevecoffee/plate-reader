Processing Stages
- Take raw image and find plates
- Identify plate type
- Extract license number from plate
- Extract other relevant data from plate?

Output
- list of plates
  - for each plate
    - plate image geometry (four points on original should be enough to describe required iamge transformation) 
    - transformed plate image
    - confidence that this is actually a plate?
    - plate type
      - Issuer (State, Govt, etc.)
      - Subtype
    - plate ID
    - other plate-specific extracted data, if any

Dev Tasks
- get exemplars of state license plates
- test images
- research public image processing techniques for each step
- choose dev environment and language
